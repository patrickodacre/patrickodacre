## G'Day!

My name is Patrick O'Dacre, and I'm a software engineer living in Canada, eh.

I am currently working on various projects using Go, Hyperledger and Solidity.

I started my coding adventure with PHP and JavaScript in 2015, but have found myself completely taken with <img src="https://github.com/patrickodacre/patrickodacre/blob/master/assets/gopher.svg" height="20" /> Go, decentralized web and blockchain.
